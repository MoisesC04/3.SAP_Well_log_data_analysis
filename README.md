## Subject: Well log data analysis

This repository focuses on the analysis and interpretation of Well Log Data from the SinÃº-San Jacinto Basin using Python. The dataset includes many Well Log Registers, which can be used to identify typical behaviors and characteristics. Additionally, Fourier Transform is applied to understand the spectral forms of each register.

The data is stored in a file named 'MainFile_Data', and the entire analysis process is in the 'Analysis_Code' file, which is implemented in Python. While the methodology used here may be considered experimental, it provides meaningful insights when examined in detail. These insights are documented in the 'Analysis_Report' file, which includes a comprehensive discussion of the results. Note that some of the generated graphics may appear abstract due to their inherent nature, but they are carefully analyzed and explained in the report.

>[!NOTE]
>The techniques applied in this analysis are:
>- Data processing, cleaning, filtering and visualization.
>- Fourier Transform for spectral analysis.
>- Cross-correlation to identify patterns.
>- Discussion and thoughts.
